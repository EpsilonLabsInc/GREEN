8/2/22


FINDINGS:
 

Bones: No apparent acute fracture or subluxation. Facet arthropathy. Postoperative changes of anterior spinal fusion at L4-L5 and L5-S1. Hypodensity of the inferior endplate of L5.

Alignment: Mild retrolisthesis of L1 on L2. Mild anterolisthesis of L5 on S1. No alignment change on flexion and extension positioning. Mild levoconvexity of the lumbar spine centered at L2-L3. 

Disc spaces: Multilevel narrowing.

Soft Tissues: No acute findings.



IMPRESSION:
 


Hypodensity of the inferior endplate of L5 adjacent to the disc spacer hardware, slightly more pronounced than on remote prior, but without increased loss of height. Nevertheless, this raises concern for a slightly worsening chronic lytic process such as particle disease or osteomyelitis. Correlate with ESR and consider MRI with artifact suppression technique, and/or bone scan.

Postsurgical changes without evidence of dynamic instability.

Degenerative changes as described.
